# OpenStreetMap micro-tasks

This is a tool for performing micro-tasks to improve the OpenStreetMap.

### Getting started

Head over to [the website of this project](https://ent8r.github.io/osm-microtasks/) and select a task.
You will get a list of things which need to be fixed.

### Tasks

Currently there are only a few tasks you can do. More will be added in the future. But what you can do so far is:
- Convert telephone numbers into the international format [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)
  - You will see the old phone number and the new, international phone number next to each other
  - Click "check" if the number was converted correct
  - The new number will be updated in the background
  - Please check the numbers carefully!
